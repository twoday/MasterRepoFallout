<div id="rules">
<b>Revised Staff Rules and Punishment Clarification</b><br><br>
<br>
<b>1. Character Accounts</b><br>
Only 1 player per IP<br>
Exceptions: Family [up to 3 players per IP] … Players will have to notify a staff member about multiple accounts playing on the same IP. <br>
Players who are caught with multiple accounts will have all alternatives deleted and the original account set back to level 1. If they proceed to make multiple accounts all accounts will be deleted and IP will be blocked.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Bug Abuse / Error</b><br><br>
	Players who blatantly ignore reporting a bug / error will be banned for 7 days. They can request an appeal for their punishments. Those who stumble upon a bug / error and report, and it causes others to abuse the bug / error will be given a visual warning with Bug / Error gains stripped. [There is no appeals for stripped resources.] <br>
Publicly stating a bug will result in a hefty mute [1 hour]. Bugs and Errors are to be sent through the report panel. If players keep publicly stating bugs after their mute they will be banned for 7 days. [Appeals are allowed (if the bug / error isn’t severe ).]<br>
<br>
<b>3. Bots/Scripting</b><br><br>

	- Any player found to be automating the game by any method (i.e. filling botchecks, auto-healing, etc.) to be fully reset for first offence with 7 day ban [No Appeals]. After their banning if they resume Bots/ Scriptings they will be permabanned. <br>
<br>
<b>4. Hacking/Unauthorised access</b><br><br>
	If proven that a player is trying to access or has accessed another player’s account / database they are banned. [Appeals are granted if they show definite proof of not accessing players account / database.]<br>
<br>
<b>Chat and Forum Rules</b><br><br>
I. Language<br>
	Players are only allowed to speak English in chat. If they mistakenly post other languages in chat it will be a warning. Partial language is allowed such as [Hola / Bonjour / Amigos … etc. ] If they proceed after a warning it will be a Time-out then a Mute. In case of a player not understanding they have to speak English, try to attempt some mutual grounding and find a translation to let them know the rules of English Only. <br>
<br>
<b>1. Offensive Language</b><br><br>
	All offensive language is banned throughout all public chats. The server will censor them out. If a player finds a way to bypass the censoring they will be given a 1 hour mute with no warnings or time-outs. <br>
	Blatantly disrespecting players will result in a warning then a 15 minute mute.<br>
If they push the disrespect to other form [inside fallout chronicle]; such as Forums, Messages, and whispers it will become triple of their punishment. [ 15 Minutes + 45 Minutes. It will triple their punishment and tack on the original punishment.] Baiting other players to use disrespect will also cause a tripled punishment. If there are duelling players, strongly suggest the ignore feature. <br>
<br>
<b>2. Harassment</b><br> 
I. Degrading players by their morals, race, sexual orientation, gender, religion or disability will result in a 24 hour mute without warning or time-outs. If players continue it will go to a 7 day ban [no appeals]. <br>
	- If players walk the line of disrespecting others give them a nudge to show them it may cause discomfort in players if they proceed. A [nudge] is not a warning it is a common response to show players you are trying to help them not get punished for something that can be easily fixed.<br>
II. Attempting to contact a player if they may have you on ignore will result in a warning then a timeout. If a player uses other players or staff to contact a player will result in an instant time-out then a 15 minute mute. <br>
III. Attempting to harass a staff member [Administrator / Moderator] will result in a 72 hour mute. <br>
	III-a. Staff Bashing / Baiting will result in a 7 day ban [No Appeals].<br>
<br>
<b>3. Spam</b><br><br>
	When a players spams, it results in a warning. The punishments will proceed as follows: Timeout then 15 minute mute. Punishments will still occur if uncontrollable forces causes a key malfunction, animals, or other people interacting with the game. Players who cause a scrollbar will be given a hefty punishment of 24 hours. [Including Sasha’s 3 cats.]<br>
<br>
<b>4. External Links</b><br><br>
	Players posting links that will freeze the browser, leads to unwanted websites, refresh the game page to another website, posting the logout link, downloading malware or other malicious programs will result in a 7 day ban [ No appeals ]. <br>
